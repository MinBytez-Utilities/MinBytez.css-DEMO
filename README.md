# MinBytez.css


<h1><b>STILL IN  INTENSE ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT :)))</b></h1>

<h2>Since the parser isn't fully finished, I don't plan to have any sort of special event or ceremony for the release MinBytez.css. MinBytez.css will be released under a rolling-release update scheme, a software upgrade system that will ultimately improve the overall quality of the framework. I plan to have roll out updates every hour or so. </h2>
