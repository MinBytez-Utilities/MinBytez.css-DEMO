# MinBytez.css


<h1><i>STILL UNDER  INTENSE ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT :)))</i></h1>

<h2>Since the parser isn't fully finished yet, I don't plan to have any sort of special event or ceremony for the stable release of MinBytez.css. MinBytez.css will be released under a rolling-release update scheme, a software update system that will ultimately improve the overall quality of the framework. I plan to roll out *MAJOR* updates every hour or so. No, I'm not crazy or retarded. I'm just focused on making web development as robust, decentralized, lightweight, un-obfuscated and fast as possible while also contributing to the CSS ecosystem by innovating new CSS features that's never been developed before.    </h2>
